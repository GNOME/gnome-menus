gnome-menus
===========

gnome-menus contains the libgnome-menu library, the layout configuration
files for the GNOME menu, as well as a simple menu editor. The layout
files control the menu layout for the GNOME Classic desktop. They are
unused in normal GNOME sessions and have no effect outside GNOME Classic.

The libgnome-menu library implements the "Desktop Menu Specification"
from freedesktop.org:

You may download updates to the package from:

Installation
============

See the file 'INSTALL'. If you are not using a released version of
gnome-menus (for example, if you checked out the code from git), you
first need to run './autogen.sh' to create the 'INSTALL' file.
